While making it live I have faced many problems. Facing the CROS issue for atleast 2 weeks. I have joined the session also for the solution. But didn't able to solve that in that session. But the teacher told me the issue and why it is happening.

Tha issue is happening with `VERCEL`. I tried to understand the problem and solved the issue.

Backend is giving issue in `VERCEL` so for backend I have used `RENDER` and for frontend I have used vercel.
